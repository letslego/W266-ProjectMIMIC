## Document/Notes Representation

The clinical notes related to an admission are located in the NOTEEVENTS and ADMISSION tables.
The ADMISSION table has only one type of clinical note, the one related to the preliminary diagnoses done during admission.
The NOTEEVENTS contains all the other type of clinical notes, here is a list of these types
```
mimic=# select category from noteevents group by category;
     category
-------------------
 ECG
 Respiratory
 Discharge summary
 Radiology
 Rehab Services
 Nursing/other
 Nutrition
 Pharmacy
 Social Work
 Case Management
 Physician
 General
 Nursing
 Echo
 Consult
(15 rows)

``` 
The baseline will use ONLY the 'Discharge Summary' clinical notes. (note: we may use the other clinical notes for the final project)

Previous research represents this documents as bag-of-words vectors [1]. In particular, it takes the 10,000 tokens with the largest tf-idf scores from the training.   

(note for the final model: we could use here POS tagging, parsing and entity recognition)

## ICD9-codes

The DIAGNOSES_ICD table contains the ICD9-codes assigned to a hospital admission. There could be many ICD9-codes assigned to one admission.
There are 57,786 admissions in this table, with a total of 651,047 ICD9-codes assigned.

Related previous research didn't work with all ICD9-codes but only with the most used in diagnoses reports[2] [3]. We will not consider ICD9-codes that start with "E" (additional information indicating the cause of injury or adverse event) nor "V" (codes used when the visit is due to circumstances other than disease or injury, e.g.: new born to indicate birth status)   

*	We identify the top 20 labels based on number of patients with that label. 
*	We then remove all patients who donâ€™t have at least one of these labels,  
*	and then filter the set of labels for each patient to only include these labels.   

As a result, we get 45,293 admissions with 152,299 icd9-codes (only including the ones in the top 20)

Here is the list of the top 20 ICD9-codes that will be used in the baseline

```
select icd9_code, COUNT(DISTINCT SUBJECT_ID) subjects_qty 
from diagnoses_icd  where SUBSTRING(icd9_code from 1 for 1) != 'V' 
group by icd9_code order by subjects_qty  
desc  limit 20;

icd9_code | icd9_q

(note: for the final model, do we consider the code's description and/or hierarchy?)

## Baseline Model
A neural network (not Recurrent) with one hidden layer, with relu activation on the hidden layer and sigmoid activation on the output layer.   Using cross entropy loss,which is the loss functions for multilabel classification [4]   
   
(note: not sure what will go in each cell for a recurrent network, one paper uses the last 20 notes for each admission and feeds one note to each cell.. but if we use just the discharge summary, then we could feed a sentence to each cell, or a word.. but that would be too many cells... something to consider later on)

## Evaluation
rank loss metric to evaluate performance [3] or F1 score [2] .. or both  (not sure yet)
