Pt was in his USOH until about 2-3 days PTA, when he began experiencing intermittent nausea. He had 2-3 episodes of coffee-ground emesis and 1 episode of tarry black stool in the morning of admission. He reports some lightheadedness which is not new, but denies frank hematemesis, BRBPR, abdominal pain, fever, chills, significant increases in his abdominal girth. He denies drinking or medication non-compliance. He also reports taking naproxen for back pain 2-3 times a day in the recent past. . In the ED, his vitals were 97.4, 93/41, 69, 18, 100% on RA. He was given 4L NS IV, protonix 40mg IV, started on an octreotide drip. He had guaiac positive brown stool on rectal exam. He was seen by the liver fellow in the ED who felt this was unlikely a variceal bleed and recommended work up for infection. An NG tube was attempted, however, patient was unable to tolerate it in the ED. Abdominal ultrasound was done which showed a patent portal vein, scant ascites but not enough to tap. BP dropped to 80/34, pt transferred to MICU for hemodynamic monitoring. . In the MICU, pt was given 3 pRBC, Hct bumped from 21.3 to 28. Started on norepinephrine gtt for a few hours, but BP stabilized. On transfer to the floor, remains hemodynamically stable. Feels good, denies tarry or bloody BMs, emesis. Past Medical History: HCV Cirrhosis (tx with interferon x2 with no response) Portal Gastropathy Grade II Esophageal varices HTN Social History: He lives alone.  He is drinking alcohol, usually one session per week. He has four to five drinks per session. He was told to completely abstain from alcohol, effective as of today. He smokes about 20 cigarettes per day.

MICROBIOLOGY: Blood, urine cultures - negative H.pylori serum antibody - negative . CARDIOLOGY: . TTE ([**4-18**]): Conclusions The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Hyperdynamic LV systolic function. Mild mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. .

GI: EGD ([**4-20**]): 1. Varices at the lower third of the esophagus and middle third of the esophagus. 2. Erythema and erosion in the antrum and pylorus compatible with non-steroidal induced gastritis. 3. Bleeding from a pyloric ulcer in the pylorus compatible with non-steroidal induced ulcer (injection, thermal therapy). 4. Normal mucosa in the duodenum. 5. Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum . RADIOLOGY: . CXR ([**4-17**]): The prominent bulge to the right heart border could be due to pericardial effusion, _____ cyst, and enlarged right atrium. There is no mediastinal vascular engorgement to suggest cardiac tamponade. Pulmonary vasculature is normal. The lungs are clear and there is no pleural effusion. Overall heart size is normal. Right jugular line ends at the junction of the brachiocephalic veins. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion. . ABD U/S ([**4-17**]): IMPRESSION: 1.

EGD revealed erythema and erosion in the antrum and pylorus compatible with non-steroidal induced gastritis. Pt did remember taking increased doses of naproxen for backache. Started on pantoprazole 40mg PO BID for one week with repeat endoscopy scheduled in one week ([**4-30**]). Recommended to take tylenol (max daily dose of 2gm) for pain instead of NSAIDs. Blood pressure meds were held at first, given MICU admission for hypotension, but were restarted on discharge. . # HCV Cirrhosis: appears to be progressing to liver failure, with elevated INR at 1.6, decreased albumin at 2.6, tbili slightly elevated at 3.6, and chronic LE edema.

Discharge Disposition: Home Discharge Diagnosis: Peptic ulcer GI bleed Discharge Condition: asymptomatic Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for bleeding from an ulcer in your stomach. This ulcer is at least partially caused by naproxen.  You should stop taking naproxen and take only tylenol for pain.  You should not take any NSAIDS for pain including ibuprofen, naproxen, aleve, motrin, aspirin, toradol, or advil. It is okay to take tylenol but do not take more than 4 extra strength tylenol a day (2gram daily maximum). . The following medication changes were made: Do not take naproxen Take pantoprazole 40 mg twice daily for one week.  Then take 40 mg daily. . You are scheduled to get a repeat endoscopy next week.  Prior to the procedure do not have anything to drink or eat after midnight. . Please return to the ER if you have any chest pain, lightheadeness, fever, chills, bloody or black stools or any other concerning symptoms.
