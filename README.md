### Notebooks

1. Basic Baseline: /baseline/*
2. SVM Baseline: /svm_baseline/*  (all files in this directory, code, readme and data) had been copied from https://physionet.org/works/ICD9CodingofDischargeSummaries, which only MIMIC authorized users should have access, then I think they should not be present in this repository, correct?)
3. NN Baseline: /baseline/*
4. Notes Exploration with Named Entity Recognition: /notes_exploration/*

Note: this repositiory does not contain files with MIMIC data because they need MIMIC authorization:
